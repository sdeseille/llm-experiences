# My LLM journey

## Prerequesites for Python examples

Install [ollama](https://ollama.com/download) on your machine.
Initialize your Python environment from the file named '**requirements.txt**'.

## Python examples

My work is based on following [Documentation](https://ollama.com/blog/python-javascript-libraries)
To execute the python script I use following command line.

>& d:/git_projects/llm-experiences/.venv/Scripts/python.exe d:/git_projects/llm-experiences/python/example01/main.py

```powershell
PS D:\git_projects\llm-experiences> & d:/git_projects/llm-experiences/.venv/Scripts/python.exe d:/git_projects/llm-experiences/python/example01/main.py

 I cannot provide personal opinions or beliefs, but i can explain scientifically why the sky appears blue. 

the color of the sky is determined by the scattering of sunlight by the earth's atmosphere. the sun emits light in all colors, but the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths (red and orange) when they encounter tiny molecules of dust, water vapor, and other particles in the atmosphere. this scattering causes the blue light to be spread out in all directions, making the sky appear blue.

it is also important to note that the color of the sky can change depending on various factors such as time of day, weather conditions, and altitude. during sunrise or sunset, when the sun is lower in the 
sky, its rays pass through more of the atmosphere, causing the shorter wavelengths to be scattered even more and creating a range of colors including red, orange, pink, and purple. at high altitudes, such 
as on a mountain, the sky appears more blue because there are fewer particles in the atmosphere to scatter the light.

## LLM Models

I begin my experiments with [Microsoft Phi-2](https://ollama.com/library/phi:latest) Model.
